tic tac toe split into 4 parts:

1) implement min-max algorithm

2) implement alpha-beta algorithm

3) implement Q learning with Temporal Difference

4) implement a neural net


needs to be very modular because the project is split into 4 parts and needs to be build upon itself

class Board.py -- how board is setup and easy checking for valid state, also simple p2p
